/// Calculates the width and height of a chart.
///
/// An AspectRatio is built from the available constructors: `[inner|outer|environment]_[width|height|ratio]`
///
/// The first part `[inner|outer|environment]` is a choice of what kind of dimensions are we calculating:
/// 1) the inner chart area,
/// 2) the outer chart including the edge layout,
/// 3) or from the environment using parent container dimensions (and then using them as an outer chart).
///
/// The second part `[width|height|ratio]` is a choice of which variable to calculate from the formula: `width / height = ratio`.
///
/// ## Why is this important?
///
/// See the [sunspot activity example](https://feral-dot-io.github.io/leptos-chartistry/examples#aspect-ratio) for a visual demonstration.
///
/// ## Practical advice
///
/// Bank to 45 degrees. [^bank]
///
/// Bank the slopes of your lines to an average of 45 degrees and you'll maximise the ability to differentiate slope differences. Sunspots become readable. This is intended as a good heuristic to start with and then adjust as needed.
///
/// You should preference "inner" dimensions when you can which leads to a chart-centric approach (the chart is always matches your intention). However charts also live on a web page with constraints -- and its in this context that you'll probably prefer to work with a chart with known "outer" dimensions. When using outer dimensions try to ensure the layout is a fixed size regardless of the input data and this will be just as good as having a fixed inner chart (setting [TickLabels::min_chars](crate::TickLabels::min_chars) on the Y axis is an example of this).
///
/// Finally the "environment" dimensions work great for automatically grabbing the width or height from the parent container. The same caveats as "outer" apply but you have less control. YOLO! The risk is that if you change the page and incidentally change the dimensions, you'll change your perception of the chart.
///
/// I find that there's usually an obvious choice of width or height to pick from e.g., my page is growing horizontally or I'm expecting a lot of free space to the side. In these cases, I'll pick that variable and use a ratio that fits well for the chart. You can't really go wrong here as they're all part of the same choice.
