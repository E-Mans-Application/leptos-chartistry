## Review

## TODO

- Should min/max range for x and y axis be on Series or Chart?
- Remove <T> in favour of data being an Iterator?
- API: `Stack::push` has `mut Self -> Self` builder pattern.
- Panic if colour scheme with zero colours is used.
- Colours
    - Need a general write up on difficulties
    - Stacked colours iterate but should use sequential colours with "min step by" fn
    - Default stacked colours is not one colour
