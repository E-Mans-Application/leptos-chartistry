# Leptos Chartistry

An extensible charting library for Leptos.

## Review

- https://github.com/cxli233/FriendsDontLetFriends

## TODO

- Should min/max range for x and y axis be on Series or Chart?
- Remove <T> in favour of data being an Iterator?
- Stacked colours iterate but should use sequential colours with "min step by" fn
- Default stacked colours is not one colour
